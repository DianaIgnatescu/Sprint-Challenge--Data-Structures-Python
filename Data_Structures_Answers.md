Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

    O(1) because using append only overrides values instead of growing the list.

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

    O(1) because capacity remains constant and using append only overrides values instead of growing the list.

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

    O(n) because of the list comprehension.

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

    O(n) because of the list comprehension.

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
